# Weather App
A simple weather app that uses tkinter and the OpenWeatherMaps API to display an application which gathers an input for the city name and shows current weather conditions. You must create an account at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and generate an API key. Then, paste the key into Line 7, leaving the quotations. The app also uses simple icons to improve user experience.
